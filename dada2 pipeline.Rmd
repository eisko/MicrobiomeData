## Dada2 Pipeline

See [dada2 github](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) for more details including tutorial (used to construct this pipeline).

Note, loaded dada2 from anaconda cloud, v1.14.0

Assumptions made in making this pipeline:
* samples were already demultiplexed, (true, cuz reads split into individual per-sample fastq files)
* adapters were removed, 
* and sequences paired (??? only one fastq files, no read 1/2 aka read f/r)
prior to sending fastq sequences
